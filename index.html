          <h1>Rufus Hound Reveals The Savage Insult From Kim Woodburn That Made Him Quit</h1>
          
            <p>Yesterday, Kim Woodburn appeared on This Morning and it all kicked off. She ended up having a massive argument with Phillip Schofield, while Holly frantically tried to diffuse the situation.There was one particular comment about an argument on Celebrity Juice which got people a lit bit confused, what were they on about?! We know that Kim loses her shit like it's her full-time job, but what was this in reference to?Now however, it's all crystal clear, and it involves comedian Rufus Hound.
</p>
            <p>She basically kept saying I was fat. But I did end up saying, 'That's a bit rich coming from a woman who looks like a face drawn on a deflating party balloon'."Bloody hell. Sounds like this all got very personal very quickly.</p>
